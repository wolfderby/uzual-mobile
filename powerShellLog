The following APIs have moved to separate packages and importing them from the "expo" package is deprecated: Constants.

1. Add correct versions of these packages to your project using:

   expo install expo-constants

   If "install" is not recognized as an expo command, update your expo-cli installation.

2. Change your imports so they use specific packages instead of the "expo" package:

 - import { Constants } from 'expo' -> import Constants from 'expo-constants'


register
